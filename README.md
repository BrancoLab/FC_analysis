#### Please note: this is still very much work in progress! 
Many bugs still need to be dealth with, many more functionalities are to be added. As the code is ever-changing the content of this introduction may not fully reflect the reality of the scripts (it might be outdated). 

# FC_analysis
Fede's analysis code, all things tracking, plotting and modelling

The code in this repo is intended to go from Raw data to modelling, from tracking to plotting and so on. 
This structured analysis pipeline should facilitate the analysis of one's experiments while simultaneously organise the 
results to facilitate storage. The data and the results of the analsys are inserted into a database where each datapoint has an accompanying metadata containing all relevant information (e.g. experiment date, type...). This should facilitate retrival of previously analysed data for subsequent analysis steps (e.g. use previous tracking data for plotting). 

A more detailed description of how the analysis code and database are structured can be found here:
